  <h2>My Studies : IESEG School of Management</h2>
  <p>
  I have always wanted to work in business, which is why I chose to make it the subject of my studies. Only in my second year, I am already very interested in Marketing, Management and Human Resources.

  <h2>My travels</h2>
  <p>
  Since I was little, I dreamed of going around the world. As I grew up, I quickly realized that it would be a bit complicated to do everything at once, so I am realizing my dream step by step.

  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>
  Music has a very important place in my life. It follows me throughout my life, accompanying me in good and bad times. I listen to music all the time and I even learn to play it with a piano.
